# Overleave

Hot reload extension for overleaf to use compiler and text editor in different windows.

This project is a Chrome extension that, when in an Overleaf project, opens the compiled pdf in a new tab. I built this because I prefer the local TeX experience where I can typeset in one window and leave the compiled pdf in another window; however, Overleaf doesn't have this functionality.

Features:

* Supports private Overleaf projects
* Automatically rerenders pdf when the Overleaf project recompiles

## Setup

You can run the extension in any chromium based web browser. To run in developer mode, you can:

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)
3. Enable the "Developer mode" switch in the top right
4. Click "Load Unpacked" in the left hand side
5. Upload the project

## Next Improvements 

* Availabiity in Chrome for overleave extension.
* Availability in Edge for overleave extension.
* Better UI with activation.
* Guidelines in the UI for usability.
* Link to overleaf for productivity.
